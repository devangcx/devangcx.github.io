## Engineer / Architect

I am currently a software engineer.

In the past, I have been a design technologist,a building performance consultant, 
an architect, a project manager, and a team leader.

This site is currently a work in progress and I plan to fully build this over the next year.

If the look and feel of this website feels familiar to you,
you have a great taste in people. It is inspired by [Kailash Nadh's](https://nadh.in/)
personal website. Kailash is one of the few engineers I have come to admire 
from afar.

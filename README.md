## Personal blog
This has gone through several iterations in terms of style, and technology
over the years.
- Started off as a HTML + CSS + JS [site](https://github.com/devangcx/devangcx.github.io/tree/d20e14dc22c0e613819ff77af03514c00c808eb8) and remained in that form for a long time.
- A Hugo powered static [site](https://github.com/devangcx/devangcx.github.io/tree/92026463eb503400f765a23f92a9c277b1281517) for a brief period.
- And now, a React app.
